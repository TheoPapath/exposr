# exposr

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

**exposr** is an R package that aspires to provide a flexible and
extensible toolkit for exposure‚Äìresponse analysis and pharmacometric
data exploration.

Designed by and for pharmacometricians, `exposr` aspires to bridge the
gap between simulation, visualization, and decision-support in
model-informed drug development (MIDD). It will support intuitive
workflows for both exploratory data analysis and communication of
results to scientific and regulatory stakeholders.

## Installation

You can install the development version of exposr from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("TheoPapath/exposr")
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üöÄ Why exposr?

In pharmacometrics, we frequently ask: - How does drug **exposure**
relate to **efficacy** or **safety**? - Is there a consistent
**dose‚Äìexposure‚Äìresponse** relationship across trials? - Can we
visualize trends and model predictions in a way that's **clear and
credible**?

`exposr` is built to help answer these questions with:

-   ‚úÖ Clean, publication-ready exposure‚Äìresponse plots
-   ‚úÖ Support for external model overlays and prediction ribbons
-   ‚úÖ Dose binning and summary tools that respect clinical structure
-   ‚úÖ Flexible trend fitting (e.g. LOESS, GLM, Emax)
-   ‚úÖ Annotations for go/no-go thresholds and effect levels
-   ‚úÖ Utility functions for simulation, model diagnostics, and more (in
    development)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ‚ú® Key Features

-   **`plot_exposure_response()`**: A core visualization tool that
    handles:
    -   Dose, exposure, and response layering
    -   Grouping by trial or covariates
    -   Trend overlays (LOESS, linear, Emax, etc.)
    -   Exposure bin summaries with 95% CIs
    -   Prediction overlays from external models
    -   Median line annotations, effect crosshairs, and more
-   **Simulation support** *(coming soon)*:
    -   Dose‚Äìresponse data generation with random effects
    -   Dropout modeling and interim decision logic
    -   Multiple-dose and longitudinal design exploration
-   **Future tools** *(planned)*:
    -   Vignettes and templates for reporting

## üì¶ Installation

```{r}
# You can install the development version from GitHub:
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("TheoPapath/exposr")
```

## üß™ Example Usage

```{r}
library(exposr)

# plot_exposure_response(
#   data = my_data,
#   dose_var = Dose,
#   exposure_var = AUC,
#   response_var = Response,
#   group_var = Trial,
#   summary_type = "geometric",
#   add_trend = TRUE,
#   trend_method = "emax",
#   trend_ci = TRUE
# )

```

üß¨ Target Audience This package is designed for:

-   Pharmacometricians
-   Clinical pharmacologists
-   Quantitative scientists

## üåç Vision 

The goal of exposr is to become a lightweight but powerful companion
package for pharmacometricians ‚Äî supporting rapid iteration, insightful
communication, and reproducible science.

Whether you're prototyping an exposure‚Äìresponse model, exploring trial
simulations, or assembling results for an IND, exposr aims to support
your workflow.
